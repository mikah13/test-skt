### Project Description
ODEN (Open Data Developer Network) is a novel system for helping developers easily find and consume Open Data in their mobile apps or websites. Open Data is data that can be freely used  re-used and redistributed by anyone.  ODEN's developer community needs a wealth of Open Data to exist from a variety of sources for the apps they develop. The issue we have is that not all of those who want to supply Open Data understand the format Open Data requires. The goal of this project is to create an Open Data Editor to make this process easier. ODEN makes use of schemas <a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a> to describe what Open Data looks like. The Open Data Editor will allow those with limited technical knowledge to easily create/edit Open Data without needing to understand these underlying schemas.  The Open Data Editor will be a dynamic web form that is built from the selected schema and needs to show an HTML representation of the data in an easy to understand visual as it is being put in

This document will walk you through the process of setting up and creating the application of Team 3.
